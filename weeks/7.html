Ms. Clark read us a couple pages of the prologue and told us a little bit about the story. We had to answer questions 3, 4, and 5. Starting with number 1. Then we went to lunch. Then we came back. We were supposed to read through page 26 and answer an indefinite number of questions in the packet. Of course, this goal was a bit too lofty. Then we went to the library to work on a graphic organizer about Nevil Shute Norway, his life, and his contributions. <a href="/ht/library.html">#library</a></p><h2 id="wednesday-day-30">Wednesday: Day 30</h2><p>Taking out our Chaucer packets, we were supposed to have done up through number 15 and be significantly further in reading the prologue than anyone was. So she opens the floor for questions about any of the questions we’ve “already done”.</p><p>“What was number 11?” One student asks … “and number 9,” interjects another. We proceed to go through questions 9 through 15, out of order, her giving us the answers. Then we “moved on” to question 16. Of course, no one knew the answer because no one can read that much prologue in the time we were allotted yesterday. She simply tells us the answers while quoting a line or two from the text, all the way to number twenty.</p><p>Returning from lunch, everyone was dreading doing more of the packet. It was seriously the most boring thing we’ve ever done in that class <a href="#fn1">[1]</a>. We continued the packet filling-out as before, going to number ~25. Then we went to the library! To ‘work’ on our castle stories. <a href="/ht/library.html">#library</a></p><h2 id="thursday-day-31">Thursday: Day 31</h2><blockquote><p>Today is castle story day.</p></blockquote><p>Today is castle story day! … At least for before lunch. We went around the room stating which castle we wrote our five page short story about, and the basic plot of our story. If it needed to be stapled, there was an operational stapler on the desk. Then she told us about one of the Canterbury Tales, although most of the class was too concerned with lunch.</p><p>After lunch, Ms. Clark had to leave for some reason, but the sub was late to arrive. We were supposed to finish reading the prologue and associated packet. Then we were to work on our <em>new</em> Knight’s Tale packet. The sub was in no mood to make us work but we did do at least 5 of the 13 (we were supposed to) of the more than 20 questions in the packet. <a href="/ht/sub.html">#sub</a></p><h2 id="friday-day-32">Friday: Day 32</h2><p>As is the case for all Fridays, the part before lunch was spent studying vocab, and then we took the vocab quiz. <em>Then</em> we watched a part of the movie <em>On the Beach</em> corresponding to our book, <em>On the Beach</em>. <a href="/ht/vocab.html">#vocab</a> <a href="/ht/movie.html">#movie</a></p><h4 id="notes">Notes</h4><p><a name="fn1">[1]</a> Yes, that is saying something.</p></div></div><hr><footer><p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> &copy; 2016 <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"> <img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="/by-nc.png" /> </a> | <a href="/about.html">About</a></p><small> This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License </a>. </small></footer></div></body></html>
