The sub announced that we had some work to do, including a page of questions about <em>On the Beach</em>. And she told us to continue reading the Knight’s Tale. Personally, I answered the questions. The same cannot be said for the rest of the class. It can be said that no one read the Knight’s Tale.</p><p>After lunch, we continued doing the same stuff until we were allowed to go to the library to selecta [sic] <a href="#fn1">[1]</a> topic for our Middle Ages Project, which was “assigned” today by way of handout. No one knew what to do because the “assignment” was laughably vague. We’ll see what we’re actually supposed to do when Ms. Clark decides to show up. <a href="/ht/sub.html">#sub</a> <a href="/ht/vocab.html">#vocab</a></p><h2 id="tuesday-day-34">Tuesday: Day 34</h2><p>A good couple of minutes were spent figuring out what we did yesterday. She quickly came to the realization that we were <em>not</em> on part four of the Knight’s Tale, and rather were still at the beginning. But first, we needed to go over our answers to the <em>On the Beach</em> worksheet. For each question, she gave us a wrong answer (popular opinion is that she is going by the movie rather than the book).</p><p>After lunch, we finished that up, and then she started reading The Knight’s Tale aloud from the beginning. Sometimes she didn’t read the rhymes, which angered me. After some pages, she decreed that we would finish part 1 by ourselves, which we “did”. Then she went through the questions in the packet, giving us the answers, just like old times. Needless to say, we did not finish part 1. And, in fact, we had already done ~7 of the questions. What we accomplished today: Answering ~3 questions.</p><blockquote><p>I don’t want to waste your time.</p></blockquote><h2 id="wednesday-day-35">Wednesday: Day 35</h2><p>At the beginning of class, she pretended to not know where we are in The Knight’s Tale. She was pleasantly surprised to find out that we were almost done with part I. She told us some answers to the packet…sort of. After lunch, we had to read part IV. Part III is ‘unimportant’, as is part II. Then we went to the library to pick a topic (again) for our Middle Ages project. <a href="/ht/library.html">#library</a></p><h2 id="thursday-day-36">Thursday: Day 36</h2><p>The main theme of today was Handing back Papers. For the part before lunch, she handed back stuff she had graded. After lunch, she handed back our castle short stories, asking a select few people to describe the plot of his/er story. Then she told us a little bit about the end of The Knight’s Tale—although unfortunately not enough to fill out all the answers in our packet—until it was time to go to the computer lab.</p><p>Upon entering the computer lab, the librarian reported that no one was allowed in the computer lab because it was being used for something important. So, we went into the library at large to work on … something, while Ms. Clark went around telling all the people who never actually wrote a castle short story that they had to turn one in. <a href="/ht/library.html">#library</a></p><h2 id="friday-day-37">Friday: Day 37</h2><p>We arrived in class with the quick announcement that it was time to go to the Career Expo that was taking place in the gym. We knew this was coming; she had asked us if we thought it would be beneficial. Guess if we said yes <a href="#fn2">[2]</a>. So we proceed to the career expo. When you hear the title “career expo” you might be expecting a career expo. Rather, the career expo was in fact a college fair. Seeing as everyone had already applied to college, we just milled about for a bit until lunch. After lunch, those of us who read the sparknotes (not the actual reading, mind you) for the Miller’s Tale were taunted for being “losers” and “actually doing that”. However, the knowledge came in handy when answer the associated question packet questions. Then we viewed portions of <em>On the Beach</em>, The movie! <a href="">#expo</a> <a href="/ht/movie.html">#movie</a></p><h4 id="notes">Notes</h4><p><a name="fn1">[1]</a> Yeah, I don’t really know.
