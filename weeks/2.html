After lunch, I worked on my poster <a href="#fn1">[1]</a>. I did not finish it, even though the poster is due tomorrow. Anyways, I was promised some more time to work on it, so I’m not worried. <a href="/ht/vocab.html">#vocab</a> <a href="/ht/movie.html">#movie</a></p><h2 id="wednesday-day-six">Wednesday: Day Six</h2><p>We arrived in English with the promise of a movie. Ms. Clark spent a good deal of time messing around with the VHS that obviously didn’t work because the sound kept going in and out. This fiddling lasted until lunch during which she got a DVD version (!!). After lunch we watched the ‘film’, <em>Camelot</em>, and answered questions/notes on a sheet. <a href="/ht/movie.html">#movie</a></p><h2 id="thursday-day-seven">Thursday: Day Seven</h2><p>First, we went over the questions that I never received because I missed Tuesday <a href="#fn2">[2]</a>. One person from each “group” was supposed to say the answer, but basically she just told us the answers. I had to write really fast. After lunch, we finished up with that, and we watched a movie about King Arthur. Another one. <a href="/ht/movie.html">#movie</a></p><h2 id="friday-day-eight">Friday: Day Eight</h2><p>Upon entering the room, it was immediately evident that we had a sub today. For the before-lunch part of class, we “studied our vocab”. After lunch, we took our vocab quiz. Then we finished the movie. No one knew where we left off because no one was paying that much attention. We settled on a point 7 minutes from the end. After the movie concluded, we headed for the library to research our King Arthur (and/or Grendel) research topics. <a href="/ht/sub.html">#sub</a> <a href="/ht/vocab.html">#vocab</a> <a href="/ht/movie.html">#movie</a> <a href="/ht/library.html">#library</a></p><h4 id="notes">Notes</h4><p><a name="fn1">[1]</a> I don’t know what this “poster” was for.</p><p><a name="fn2">[2]</a> I was sick</p></div></div><hr><footer><p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> &copy; 2016 <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"> <img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="/by-nc.png" /> </a> | <a href="/about.html">About</a></p><small> This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License </a>. </small></footer></div><script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-75737254-1', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script></body></html>
