I was not in class. Neither were many others. I hear we had our vocab quiz that was supposed to be last Friday. <a href="/ht/vocab.html">#vocab</a>?</p><h2 id="tuesday-day-50">Tuesday: Day 50</h2><blockquote><p>We’re not even lying this time <span class="cite">student</span></p></blockquote><p>Oh man, was today a day. For the first part of class, we picked this week’s vocab. That was an ordeal. Then she yelled at us for watching <em>Gladiator</em> even though it wasn’t even our fault. We told her that, and she didn’t believe us. Then we got back from lunch and watched the beginning of <em>Frankenstein</em>. Oh the irony. <a href="/ht/vocab.html">#vocab</a> <a href="/ht/movie.html">#movie</a></p><h2 id="wednesday-day-51">Wednesday: Day 51</h2><p>Today was the first time in a while where the whole class was there <a href="#fn1">[1]</a>. Thus, we worked on our <em>Hamlet</em> presentations that are scheduled to start tomorrow. After lunch was an ordeal. She started off by handing out our “Term Paper Contract”, and everyone complained about it because it is stupid <a href="#fn2">[2]</a>. Then she commenced her long, squawking diatribe. She started off by talking more about <em>Frankenstein</em> and told us to skip the ‘letters’ at the beginning and to skip the first couple of chapters. Then she talked a <em>lot</em> about our term paper using countless irrelevant anecdotes of others’ college experiences. One student at BU slept through his exam. The professor told him he couldn’t make it up, but after much persuasion the prof agreed to let him take the exam. After the student had finished, he still got a zero! The professor said he could retake it but not that he would count it. Therefore, you have to do 60 notecards whether you like it or not.</p><p>Then Ms. Clark tried to explain what we were supposed to write in our “reading journal”… by telling us about an Irish short story writer named O’Flaherty. He wrote about a cluster of Irish people on some island — These people are the real Irish: they are so poor they couldn’t afford the baby calf. So they threw it off a cliff. Now … cows are pretty dumb. The mother cow was afraid of the edge. But she jumped off to be with the calf. She would write this in her journal. Then she would pick a second story. Now, you may think of immigrants to America as coming to the land of opportunity, but to the Irish they called it “going into exile.” That one doesn’t fit in with the first, so she probably wouldn’t use it. Then she would read a third short story. Now these people were so poor, they couldn’t afford to feed the dog. So they threw it off the cliff. Unlike the cow, however, he survived, and the dog forgave the people when he came ashore.</p><p>We stopped outwardly complaining about all the stuff we have to do for our term paper out of fear that she would start talking about something again. For the last 20 minutes, we messed around.</p><h2 id="thursday-day-52">Thursday: Day 52</h2><p>Something happened such that Ms. Clark had to leave at 12. She took the part of class before lunch to explain the plan for the next couple of days. I didn’t pay attention because whatever she says isn’t actually going to happen. Then she started rambling about something. Both her kids have diabetes so if she goes to the doctor and asks for a treatment and they say they can give a shot to everyone to prevent diabetes, is that Frankenstein? After lunch we went to the library to do 15 to 20 notecards for our term paper. <a href="/ht/sub.html">#sub</a> <a href="/ht/library.html">#library</a></p><h2 id="friday-day-53">Friday: Day 53</h2><p>As is customary, the part before lunch was spent studying for vocab. This time we had our choice of normal dictation/write the definition <em>or</em> write a story. And if you write the story you have the vocab sheet, thus denying the vocab test from testing one’s vocab. After lunch we took said test. Then we watched <em>Frankenstein</em>. <a href="/ht/vocab.html">#vocab</a> <a href="/ht/movie.html">#movie</a></p><h4 id="notes">Notes</h4><p><a name="fn1">[1]</a> lol</p><p><a name="fn2">[2]</a> lol</p></div></div><hr><footer><p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> &copy; 2016 <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"> <img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="/by-nc.png" /> </a> | <a href="/about.html">About</a></p><small> This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License </a>. </small></footer></div><script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-75737254-1', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script></body></html>
