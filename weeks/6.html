We went through and picked 20 words that we would need to identify on a drawing of a castle on Friday. We’ll have to draw in the “siege” ourselves. After lunch, there was another exciting surprise. There was a pile of books on several of the desks. Some people grabbed one, while others waited for them to be passed to them. I think more things happened, but I forget. Anyways, after more handing out of papers of which there were not really enough, we reviewed our William knowledge. Eric was chosen randomly to be William, and Haley would be Poor Harold. Ms. Clark asked them questions for which they didn’t know the answers, but after some severe leading questions we reviewed the battle. Then she read through the paper again that said the same stuff. Then she recorded the numbers of the books. Then the bell rang late. <a href="/ht/vocab.html">#vocab</a></p><blockquote><p>We can whomp those rocks with our battle axes.</p></blockquote><h2 id="tuesday-day-24">Tuesday: Day 24</h2><p>The time before lunch was spent handing back our tests. Don’t even try to figure out how she graded the stuff. Some sections appeared to not be graded, the “points off” never added up correctly in the final score, and people who deserved the best grades didn’t get them. Fine by me!</p><h2 id="wednesday-day-25">Wednesday: Day 25</h2><p>Before lunch, we took a pop quiz on chapter 1 of <em>On the Beach</em>. No one expected that. After lunch, we continued watching the “making castles movie” and filling out the associated worksheet. Then we went to the library to find Welsh castles about which we could write our impending short story. <a href="/ht/movie.html">#movie</a> <a href="/ht/library.html">#library</a></p><blockquote><p>A Unicorn Project <span class="cite">making castles movie</span></p></blockquote><h2 id="thursday-day-26">Thursday: Day 26</h2><p>I don’t remember exactly what happened because I forgot to fill out the log. We went over the answers to the castle packet, then headed off to the library to choose once and for all which castle we’re going to write about. <a href="/ht/library.html">#library</a></p><h2 id="friday-day-27">Friday: Day 27</h2><p>Before lunch, we had our customary studying period … for the castles test! The castle test consisted of two pictures of decaying castles and a word list. We could either label parts of the castle using the words, or define the words, or use any combination of that. Then, she handed out the Chausser books and wrote down the book numbers. <a href="/ht/vocab.html">#vocab</a></p><h4 id="notes">Notes</h4><p><a name="fn1">[1]</a> Your guess is as good as mine.</p></div></div><hr><footer><p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> &copy; 2016 <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"> <img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="/by-nc.png" /> </a> | <a href="/about.html">About</a></p><small> This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License </a>. </small></footer></div></body></html>
