The two-hour-delay <a href="#fn1">[1]</a> today means that capt <a href="#fn2">[2]</a> testing starts two hours late. Classes don’t start until 11:23! English is, unfortunately, the longest of the three classes, consisting of a 20/40 split <a href="#fn3">[3]</a>. The first twenty minutes were spent discussing whether we were handing in our scholarship letters. Then new vocab was handed out. Many of the words are duplicates from two weeks ago, but we agreed not to say anything about it. We eliminated one word, bringing the total to the usual 25. We never made up last week’s vocab quiz. <a href="/ht/vocab.html">#vocab</a></p><p>After lunch, we waited for Ms. Clark to cut the big paper in half so we could draw our interpretations of Grendel! That’s right. A cool 40 mins of drawing. My picture was so slick. They’re going to be judged and given awards such as “Best of show”, “Teacher’s Pet”, the “I’m scared” award, etc. We’ll see how mine fares. <a href="/ht/art.html">#art</a></p><blockquote><p>I’m not being effusive to row 1 and row 4! <span class="not-quote"> [Meaning: the girls in row 1 and row 3 needs to stop talking. [There is no 4th row.]] </span></p></blockquote><h2 id="wednesday-day-20">Wednesday: Day 20</h2><p>We took a test.</p><h2 id="thursday-day-21">Thursday: Day 21</h2><p>As Ms. Clark handed back graded papers and vocab tests, we finished our drawings. After lunch, we were given “5” <a href="#fn4">[4]</a> more minutes to work on our drawings. Then they were placed in the hallway (with our names on the back, so we didn’t vote based on the person), and we went around all the art so we could be informed voters. We started with the worst awards and progressed up to the better awards. For each award, certain arts were nominated and then “consensus” was reached, but sometimes it was just Ms. Clark randomly taping paper ribbons on the art. The categories were:</p><ul><li>Most Barney</li><li>The “I’m scared” award</li><li>Most out-there</li><li>First place</li><li>Best of/in show</li><li>Teacher’s pet</li></ul><p>Alas, mine received no award. But at least it wont be hung up on the wall in the hallway. Then we watched a movie with inunderstandable British people talking about William the Conqueror. <a href="/ht/movie.html">#movie</a> <a href="/ht/art.html">#art</a></p><h2 id="friday-day-22">Friday: Day 22</h2><p>I bet you can guess what we did before lunch. That’s right, we spent that period of time studying for vocab. We took the test after lunch. By the time that was done with, there were about 15 minutes left for Ms. Clark to hand out a packet on “Billy” the Conqueror and for us to resume the inunderstandable film. <a href="/ht/vocab.html">#vocab</a> <a href="/ht/movie.html">#movie</a></p><h4 id="notes">Notes</h4><p><a name="fn1">[1]</a> Monday was a snow day!
