From the very start, we headed straight for the library to do a “Chaucer Scavenger Hunt”. If you are unfamiliar: scavenger hunts are what English teachers like to call worksheets that you need to use the internet to answer. The first person to complete said hunt wins “+5”. On what? Good question. Either way, she doesn’t actually check the answers, so whoever hands in the sheet with writing on it wins. Then (after lunch) we were allowed the whole period to work on our Middle Ages project. Ha. Vocab was not chosen! <a href="/ht/library.html">#library</a> <strike>#vocab</strike></p><h2 id="tuesday-day-39">Tuesday: Day 39</h2><p>We started the class by complaining about having to read too many tales and not having enough time before lunch. Either way, she started reading select lines of the Reeve’s Tale, and we were supposed to fill out some sort of graphic organizer <a href="#fn1">1</a>. After lunch, she gave up reading and instead told us what was going on, and drew quite the diagram on the board. Then we went to the library, even though we have a <em>lot</em> of tales left to do. <a href="/ht/library.html">#library</a></p><h2 id="wednesday-day-40">Wednesday: Day 40</h2><p>Oh what a day. If you’ve been following along, you know that the Medieval Projects were due today <a href="#fn1">[6]</a>. Before lunch, volunteers of non-powerpoint presenters were solicited. She mentioned something about extra credit for volunteers…we’ll see.</p><p>The class was treated to one student who literally read the incredibly long wikipedia article about his/er topic, and another who printed out his/er powerpoint because s/he can never figure out how to transfer it from computer to computer.</p><p>After lunch, we listened to more presentations. A lot of boring powerpoint presentations. One notable ppt consisted of large paragraphs of black text on picture-backgrounds resulting in a completely irreadable visual aid. In the meanwhile, the <em>Canterbury Tales</em> took another hit today, as more Tales were excised from our reading list. Now we just have to read the Bath’s Wife’s Tale or something.</p><blockquote><p>Every day I have pets in this class…what is it? Goldfish?</p></blockquote><h2 id="thursday-day-41">Thursday: Day 41</h2><p>We had a sub today—a different one than normal. I feel bad for her: she seemed competent. First of all, this little surprise meant no presentations today. The rest will be done tomorrow? Second, the sub was given instructions to teach us the Wife of Bath’s Tale. She did the best she could with our class, namely a class wholly uninterested in the Wife of Bath’s Tale. Before lunch, she had us read the prologue. This was not done. After lunch, she read the actual Tale to us. Then we were given time to fill out the questions packet. It worked fairly well. <a href="/ht/sub.html">#sub</a></p><h2 id="friday-day-42">Friday: Day 42</h2><p>Today were presentations. They were boring. They were not all presented. She won’t be there on Monday, and then we have exams…so the people who didn’t present will have to present some other time?</p><blockquote><p>Ah, that’s a very famous unicorn.</p></blockquote><h4 id="notes">Notes</h4><p><a name="fn1">[1]</a> Different than the normal worksheet.</p><p><a name="fn1">[2]</a> Ok, so you can’t really tell from just “following along”.</p></div></div><hr><footer><p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> &copy; 2016 <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"> <img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="/by-nc.png" /> </a> | <a href="/about.html">About</a></p><small> This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License </a>. </small></footer></div></body></html>
