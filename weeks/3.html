I hear we went to the library to research our topics. I bet we picked vocab, too. <a href="/ht/library.html">#library</a> <a href="/ht/vocab.html">#vocab</a>?</p><h2 id="tuesday-day-ten">Tuesday: Day Ten</h2><blockquote><p>Diffuse and browse</p></blockquote><p>We start class with a bunch of questions on <em>Grendel</em>. We divide the class into groups each responsible for 6 questions. We go to lunch. We come back. We work on the questions more. We get real excited because in twenty minutes, we’re going to the library to receive a presentation on new search engines from the librarian. <a href="/ht/library.html">#library</a></p><p>After we finish answering our six questions, we take turns answering each of the questions to the entire class, who scribble down the answer to their respective sheets. We almost finish before it’s time to go to the library. The librarian isn’t ready, so we cram into the space near the door to the computer lab. Ms. Clark announces that we should take this time to “diffuse and browse”. We mess around for some time, before Ms. Clark goes around and tells everyone that there isn’t enough time left to make it worthwhile, so we go back to the room to finish filling out our worksheets.</p><p>I see several girls from our class running around the library giggling, apparently trying to hide from Ms. Clark. Back in the classroom, it is evident that they are not there. Ms. Clark suddenly gets up and goes on a search for the girls. Unable to find them, she returns. Defeated, she announces that she was unable to find the missing students. After class was over I saw them leaving the library.</p><h2 id="wednesday-day-11">Wednesday: Day 11</h2><p>We come in to find a fun Latin game/worksheet [relevant to English], and do that until lunch. After lunch, we read some Old English book that has been badly copied onto a packet about King Arthur.</p><h2 id="thursday-day-12">Thursday: Day 12</h2><p>For the first part, we sort of did some questions on <em>Le Morte d’Arthur</em>. Then we ate lunch, and then we came back. Shortly after returning, we proceeded to the library conference room to present our 12 facts and a picture about Arthur or Grendel. What fun? <a href="/ht/library.html">#library</a></p><h2 id="friday-day-13">Friday: Day 13</h2><p>No time to study for the vocab quiz; it’s a half day: no lunch! There was a substitute who allowed us a couple minutes to study. Then, we took the vocab quiz. Then, we did “SAT Vocab Bingo” with way too many words that weren’t even on the bingo cards. We got through two-ish games but everyone was really bored and not paying attention. <a href="/ht/sub.html">#sub</a> <a href="/ht/vocab.html">#vocab</a></p></div></div><hr><footer><p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> &copy; 2016 <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"> <img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="/by-nc.png" /> </a> | <a href="/about.html">About</a></p><small> This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License </a>. </small></footer></div></body></html>
