That must have been my breaking point. Up until then, the absurdity was fun. I’d describe the day’s details with glee. There’s only so much glee a second-semester senior has to give. From this point, the glee gives way to drudgery. The log becomes a chore. The absurdity isn’t worth it anymore. We all wish Ms. Clark followed her baby calf off the cliff.</p><h2 id="monday-day-54">Monday: Day 54</h2><p>Straight into class, we went straight into the auditorium. The average student spent most of his/her time:</p><ul><li>Sleeping</li><li>Talking</li><li>Texting</li><li>Day Dreaming</li></ul><p>All while several students were on stage unenthusiastically reading their act of <em>Hamlet</em>. The best part was every once in a while, Ms. Clark would get up out of her chair, go into the aisle, look/squint at the presenters in a very interested manner, and nod before sitting back down again. A little movie was watched at the end, along with picking vocab. <a href="/ht/vocab.html">#vocab</a> <a href="/ht/movie.html">#movie</a></p><h2 id="tuesday-day-55">Tuesday: Day 55</h2><p>Before lunch we watched some movie. After that, we did yesterday again with a new group and a different act. <a href="/ht/movie.html">#movie</a></p><h2 id="wednesday-day-56">Wednesday: Day 56</h2><p>We came in to the room to find Ms. Clark not there. The sub plans called for us to watch <em>Hamlet</em> before lunch and go to the library after lunch to work on term paper notecards. Once the movie was put on, all attention-paying ceased. Everyone was just talking to one another and generally chilling. After lunch, the library was full of AP testing, so we continued to watch—excuse me, “watch” the movie. Then we went to the library for a bit to do our notecards. <a href="/ht/sub.html">#sub</a> <a href="/ht/movie.html">#movie</a> <strike>#library</strike> <a href="/ht/library.html">#library</a></p><h2 id="thursday-day-57">Thursday: Day 57</h2><p>Today we had a <strong>messed up</strong> sub. She glared at people who were talking, and told them to face forward. Everyone was just like, “yeah whateva”. She made us an offer: “if and only if” we all discuss <em>Frankenstein</em>, we can do it as a class and not have to write it down. The discussion that followed was embarrassing. After lunch we watched <em>Frankenstein</em> the movie, which was hilarious. <a href="/ht/sub.html">#sub</a> <a href="/ht/movie.html">#movie</a></p><h2 id="friday-day-58">Friday: Day 58</h2><p>Shocker!: We did vocab <strong>before</strong> lunch, once again with the choice to write a story on the computer given the words and definitions. After lunch we finished act 2 and started act 3 in the auditorium. Brilliant! <a href="/ht/vocab.html">#vocab</a></p></div></div><hr><footer><p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> &copy; 2016 <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"> <img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="/by-nc.png" /> </a> | <a href="/about.html">About</a></p><small> This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License </a>. </small></footer></div><script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-75737254-1', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script></body></html>
