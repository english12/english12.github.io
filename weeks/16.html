Then we were given more reading assignment :-( <a href="/ht/movie.html">#movie</a></p><h2 id="tuesday-day-74">Tuesday: Day 74</h2><p>Today, we started off the period by trying to tackle the enormous list of short stories and essays she handed out yesterday. Of fifteen essays, [which were supposed to have been started yesterday] we almost started reading the first. After lunch, we went to the library to work on the stories (nope), plan our Hamlet project (“yes”), or finish our rough draft for our term papers (due last Friday). I should explain the <em>Hamlet</em> project. She handed out a poorly-formatted list of project ideas, including “grab bag with 10 objects”, “write a play”, “power point presentation”, and more. Our group chose “do a movie.” We sat in the library for the rest of the period. <a href="/ht/library.html">#library</a></p><h2 id="wednesday-day-75">Wednesday: Day 75</h2><p>For the part before lunch, Ms. Clark (and various student helpers <a href="#fn1">[1]</a>) handed back graded work. This was mostly composed of vocab stories. Then, we went to the library to work on the list of short stories. After three days of work, we are almost done with the first of fifteen. <a href="/ht/library.html">#library</a></p><h2 id="thursday-day-76">Thursday: Day 76</h2><blockquote><p>You never told us we had to <strong>read</strong> it <span class="cite">The class</span></p></blockquote><p>In a particularly funny first part of class, Ms. Clark handed out a slip of paper with questions about “The Demon Lover”. Then she announced it was a quiz. The room performed an uproar, as no one had read it in spite of the ~three days of class time we had to do it. “You never told us we had to <em>read</em> it,” we complained. In the end, she just told us the answers to the four questions and it was not a quiz. But we better read it tonight, because she might give us the quiz again “tamarrow” <a href="#fn2">[2]</a>. After lunch, we went to the library to work on our projects, rough drafts (mind you, the final copy is due tomorrow), or the readings. Ha! <a href="/ht/library.html">#library</a></p><h2 id="friday-day-77">Friday: Day 77</h2><p>First, we spent the usual lot of time collecting final drafts of our literary analyses. Then we started watching <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> movie. Then we continued watching <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> movie. <a href="/ht/movie.html">#movie</a></p><h4 id="notes">Notes</h4><p><a name="fn1">[1]</a> Her terms</p><p><a name="fn2">[2]</a> She speaks like a parrot.</p></div></div><hr><footer><p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> &copy; 2016 <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"> <img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="/by-nc.png" /> </a> | <a href="/about.html">About</a></p><small> This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License </a>. </small></footer></div><script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-75737254-1', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script></body></html>
