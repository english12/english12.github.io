She was really nice so I’m not going to go into too much detail about the shenanigans that were occurring. We watched a Canterbury Tales movie: different animation styles for each tale. It was a really good review for the exam that’s happening next class day. Of course, the review wouldn’t be complete without the “review” packet she handed out on Friday, composed of several nearly-blank pieces of paper stapled together. <a href="/ht/sub.html">#sub</a> <a href="/ht/movie.html">#movie</a></p><h2 id="monday-day-44">Monday: Day 44</h2><p>Vocab was handed out. We were assigned a term paper. We went to the library for an unknown reason. <a href="/ht/vocab.html">#vocab</a> <a href="/ht/library.html">#library</a></p><h2 id="tuesday-day-45">Tuesday: Day 45</h2><p>After a bit of dilly-dallying we continued to have presentations on medieval topics. I thought this was supposed to be done by now. After lunch, Ms. Clark talked about medieval theater, and she handed out a packet and a worksheet to be completed in the library. I am inclined to believe that not many packets nor worksheets were completed in the library. <a href="/ht/library.html">#library</a></p><h2 id="wednesday-day-46">Wednesday: Day 46</h2><p>For the first part of class, she handed out <em>Frankenstein</em> and <em>Hamlet</em>, which we will apparently be reading. She talked about how Frankenstein was like face transplants and about Hamlet’s dilemmas. After lunch, she talked about medieval theater and asked questions that may have been answered if anyone had actually read the packet. But probably not. Then we assigned ourselves into groups for the five acts such that each group would present and perform one of the acts. Then we went to the library! <a href="/ht/library.html">#library</a></p><blockquote><p>Now several times throughout the play you may be thinking, “If Hamlet would just decide and go through with his decision, the play would end.” But it can’t end, because then it wouldn’t be Shakespeare. Shakespeare always had five acts.</p></blockquote><h2 id="thursday-day-47">Thursday: Day 47</h2><p>We were overjoyed to find Ms. Clark absent but wary to find a sub we had never seen before. It turns out we were in luck. This sub did not care what we did. She announced that we were supposed to read our <em>Hamlet</em>, allowing several kids to go out in the hall and several others to go to the library. After lunch, many kids did not return. We watched a movie about <em>Frankenstein</em>, and I enjoyed a nice nap. <a href="/ht/sub.html">#sub</a> <a href="/ht/movie.html">#movie</a></p><blockquote><p>If teachers are so smart, why are they still in school? <span class="cite">sticker on Ms. Clark’s podium</span></p></blockquote><h2 id="friday-day-48">Friday: Day 48</h2><p>Today was the epitome of English 12. We arrive to yet a different substitute. First of all, many are missing due to the band/chorus trip. The sub asks if anyone is actually going to prepare their <em>Hamlet</em> presentations. After much murmuring, we admitted, “no,” and decided to start the movie of our choice. Everyone agrees on <em>Gladiator</em>. By the time it’s time for lunch, we’ve completed watching all the previews on the VHS. After lunch, there were even fewer people in class. We continued to watch <em>Gladiator</em>. Then class ended. <a href="/ht/sub.html">#sub</a> <a href="/ht/movie.html">#movie</a></p></div></div><hr><footer><p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> &copy; 2016 <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"> <img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="/by-nc.png" /> </a> | <a href="/about.html">About</a></p><small> This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License </a>. </small></footer></div></body></html>
