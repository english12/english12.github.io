Then, after lunch, we worked on the packets from last Friday <em>and</em> got a new worksheet with <em>Hamlet</em> quotes we need to find and explain. Neither was finished. Our rough drafts for our term papers are due tomorrow even though everyone complained. <a href="/ht/vocab.html">#vocab</a></p><h2 id="wednesday-day-70">Wednesday: Day 70</h2><p>We spent the time before lunch handing in our paper. There was an awkward period of ~5 minutes, where we were done handing everything in, and we couldn’t start anything because of lunch. Ms. Clark stood awkwardly at the front of the class. After lunch, we watched the “funny hamlet” film. We watched the Romeo &amp; Juliet part again and then watched the actual <em>Hamlet</em> part. Then class was over. <a href="/ht/movie.html">#movie</a></p><h2 id="thursday-day-71">Thursday: Day 71</h2><p>We had the funny/strange kindergarten sub again <a href="#fn1">[1]</a>! It was super weird. We finished our <em>Hamlet</em> packet and then were supposed to start reading some short stories in the huge Literature Book and answer the critical thinking questions. We did not, and surprisingly, the sub was with us on that. She said to finish the <em>Hamlet</em> packet. Thus, we chilled. <a href="/ht/sub.html">#sub</a></p><h2 id="friday-day-72">Friday: Day 72</h2><p>Friday vocab story day: last vocab day ever! After lunch, we waited for people to finish up their stories. Then we worked on what we were supposed to have been working on the day previous. The questions were answered in the following manner: First, a dedicated core group of englishers would skim the stories and come up with a more-or-less answer to the question. Then, others would copy their papers. Still others would be too lazy to copy, and would instead ask for the answers orally from the first degree of copiers, thus creating an elaborate chain of wrong answers. Towards the end, we started a history channel movie on … the plague. Cuz we need to learn about the plague. again. for English class. <a href="/ht/vocab.html">#vocab</a> <a href="/ht/movie.html">#movie</a></p><h4 id="notes">Notes</h4><p><a name="fn1">[1]</a> The one from week insertweekhere</p></div></div><hr><footer><p style="margin-bottom: 0;"> &copy; 2016 <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"> <img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="/by-nc.png" /> </a> | <a href="/about.html">About</a></p><small> This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"> Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License </a>. </small></footer></div></body></html>
